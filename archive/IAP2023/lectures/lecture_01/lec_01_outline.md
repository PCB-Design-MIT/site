# OUTLINE

DESIGN IS THE PROCESS OF COMBINING ART AND SCIENCE TO SOLVE A PROBLEM IT IS ROOTED IN PHYSICS BUT IT IS ALSO A BEAUTIUFL METHOD OF SELF-EXPRESSION. YOU CAN TELL HOW PASSIONATE SOMEONE IS BY THE QUALITY OF THE DESIGN. 

OUR GOAL IS TO BE DIFFERENT IN THIS CLASS THAN OTHER CLASSES YOU'VE TAKEN --> MY GOAL IS TO CONVINCE YOU YOU CAN DO IT!!! YOU'RE SMART AND GREAT AND CAN DO ANYTHING!!!! 


HOW MANY OF YOU FEEL CONFIDENT IN YOUR ABILITY TO DESIGN A THING with just fundamental stuff —>  
—> what are you struggling with? THIS IS FOR YOU!!!!!!!

I DONT IM STILL LEARNING IM NOT AN EXPERT!!!
- You all already know what good design is - I just need to convince you you know it
- I will present good design but also YOU GET TO DR ME! This is how I’d do it in a design review !
- List what is good design 
- I WANT U TO ASK QUESTIONS!!!!! —> interactive!!!!!!!

MY GOALS
- How to use PHYSICS and fundamental design principals to make decision
- How to present your design in a way that is convincing 
- How to start @ the very beginning if you know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

SEVT PRES
- Design requirements START WITH GO STOP TURN AND ALSO PERFORMANCE SPECS (do freedparcc)
- Go through system - What components are we designing
- Analysis
- Selection of components 
- Design the actual gearbox 
- Threw it out the window and went to eBay 

THEN GET TO THE WHAT WE ACTUALLY ARE BUILDING!!!
- Note I’m not DONE!!!! —> I still need to REDO ALL MY MATH
- I’m doing NO FEA!!!

Last things to leave you with:
	“What if it was linear” (1/sad = happy)
	“Does it have to be a lightbulb” (joke from industrial designers, how many does it take to make a lightbulb)
	you can ALWAYS Learn something don’t be afraid to learn something

ENGINEERING IS JUST ADMITTING YOU DON’t KNOW SOMETHING

DON’T BE AFRAID TO BREAK THINGS! EMBRACE FAILURE AS YOUR BEST FRIEND!
