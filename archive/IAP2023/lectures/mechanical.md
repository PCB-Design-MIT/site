# General Info on Speaker Box

![](3.jpg)

![](8.jpg)

![](9.jpg)

Cat designed this amazing speaker box ! It holds both of the speaker drivers, the PCB, the batteries, the switch, and everything (even the class logo) into a pretty cute box that we can see through! It was NOT optimized for audio, but it's a good way to prevent all your things from falling apart.

On the lectures page, Lee Zamir did some audio engineering on a slightly more optimized box if you're interested in that! 

## How to Build the Speaker

### Materials + Tools

List of Materials:
- 1/4" Acrylic Sheet (whatever color you want)
- Bluetooth Speaker Kit from the Class
- A second driver from [here](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Visaton/FRS-8-M-8-ohm?qs=juaAHce7PkUcDlsdLt1EuA%3D%3D&mgh=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA5sieBhBnEiwAR9oh2nDFHTtG_C3diTvTk1wohk9r-snOpF1eSu328l1VWvSHqd86htHI3xoCn6YQAvD_BwE) - it's a Visaton FRS8 8Ohm driver! 

List of Tools:
- Laser Cutter (that can do 1/4" Acrylic)
- Hot Glue + Hot Glue Gun

### Cutting the Acrylic 

All of the box's DXF and SVG files for cutting are located in a zip file you can [download here](speaker_case.zip).

Have a local makerspace help you cut this! Here's some tips from Cat.
- The DXF file has some issues loading the logo PNG file sometimes so it's better to use the SVG
- the illustrator and correl draw files should both be fine but I may have forgotten to hit embed on the illustrator file

### Assembling the Speaker

To assemble the speaker, here are some loose instructions from Cat. If you need help, feel free to email her at [carase@mit.edu](mailto:carase@mit.edu).

#### Order of Assembly
- hot glue the PCB and the Speakers to their support plates first
- check the side of the USB connector when putting it together to make sure the connector aligns with the hole
- check the direction of the etched logo and other text to make sure it's the right way 
- after all the speakers and PCB and switch are mounted, THEN use hot-glue to glue the box together
- use hot glue to attach the speakers and PCB as well, be careful not to glue the diaphragm of the speakers

Once again, [email cat](mailto:carase@mit.edu) or [us](mailto:yaypcbs@mit.edu) with questions! And send us photos if you make one!!!!
