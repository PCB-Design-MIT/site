<div class="callout callout--info">
    It's worth mentioning that we haven't listed everything here! There's a lot of resources that are mentioned in the lecture notes where they're relevant - feel free to dig through those!

# Generally Useful Books

Not all of these are listed publicly because of copyright, but let us know if you have trouble finding one of them - we can definitely help :)

- The Art of Electronics, by Horowitz and Hill. Covers all the basics quite well, although the digital section is representative of a slightly different era. Basically the one book that every EE knows about.
- Practical Electronics for Inventors. Honest and down-to-earth reference for making real electronic systems.
- Principles of Power Electronics, by Kassakian, Schlecht, and Verghese. It's the textbook for 6.334 ([here's](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-334-power-electronics-spring-2007/) the OCW for it), and one of my favorite books. Commonly called KSV at MIT.
- Open Circuits, just an amazing photographic exploration of the [internal structures of electrical components.](https://opencircuitsbook.com)
