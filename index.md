title: The Art and Science of PCB Design
description: For IAP 2024, we are running a smaller, limited-enrollment course. We plan to run a full-size class in IAP 2025. Our class is full, but if you're an MIT student on campus for IAP and would like to attend the class on listener and read our lecture materials alongside the class to make your own PCB, you can add yourself to <a href='https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/pcbs-interest-iap2024'> our interest mailing list</a>. If you're from outside MIT, our content from this year will be available publicly by the end of February 2024 and we ask that you wait until then.
