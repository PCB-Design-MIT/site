# Schematic Reviews!

One of the best ways we can "debug" a schematic and PCB to have more people look at it! That's what we'll be doing in this lab. You'll be assigned a 15 minute time-slot where we'll have an LA and instructor look at your schematic. We'll give you feedback and do a quick check-in to make sure everything is going alright. The schedule is on Slack (for privacy reasons). These times are estimates, and we may be running early or late. Please be ready with your schematic open at the assigned time.

# Continuing to Design your Schematic

The rest of the time in lab is meant to be time for you to ask our staff for help! Be sure to reference [Assignment 02](../../assignments/assignment_02) to ensure that you covered all your bases. If you're choosing parts, we recommend looking at our [Component Selection Guide](../lectures/ComponentSelection). Your classmates may also be working on a similar project as you, so feel free to go around, talk to each other, and collaborate! If you need help with something specific, our [syllabus](../../syllabus/#how-do-i-get-help) has a description of each staff member's strengths :)
