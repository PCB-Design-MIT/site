<div class="callout callout--danger">
Running a class is hard! We are figuring out the due dates week-by-week and modifying them to see what works best for both you and us. This will change, so please do not get too attached to anything you see here.

This also means, a lot of our content is not complete yet. No, our last lecture is not available yet for you to read through. We will make sure things are published before we announce them publicly, but do not expect every link you see down here to work yet.
